# **WPC Panel Optimization and Experimental Data**  

This repository contains the optimization code, experimental bending test data, and scripts used to generate figures for the paper titled **Evolutionary Algorithm-Based Design and Performance Evaluation of Wood-Plastic Composite Roof Panels for Low-Cost Housing**.  

## **Repository Contents**  

- **`optimization/`** – Code implementing Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for optimizing WPC panel cross-sections.  
- **`bending_test_data/`** – Experimental data from three-point bending tests conducted according to ASTM D1037.  
- **`figures/`** – Scripts and data used to generate the plots and visualizations in the study.  

## **Requirements**  

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib** (for visualization scripts)
- **Pymoo 6.1** (for running optimization)  
- **FreeCAD Version 1.0** (required for generating and analyzing panel geometries)
